<p>It's not often that you see a post about producivity where the writer cites a scene from Forgetting Sarah Marshall. But Roz Duffy starts with the dialogue that comes in the movie:</p>

<blockquote>
	The less you do, the more you do.
</blockquote>
<p>
	I often find myself in the position Roz explains:
</p>
<blockquote>
	I have so many ideas, things I want to make and produce, and out of all of these ideas, I have been doing… nothing. Zilch. Zero. Nada. Nope.
</blockquote>
<p>
	While I have been trying to do less, sometimes I do feel that it somewhat restricts me. Although more on that in a mail I share with subscribers. Make sure you subscribe by email using the form at the top.

<p>
Keeping with the theme of doing less, Dharmesh Shah has written about how you should do fewer things and do it better. It all comes down to the three basic steps:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<ol>Decide on what matters the most.
	</ol>
	<ol>Say no to everything else.
	</ol>
	<ol>When something falls in the gray area, re-read #2.
	</ol>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Throughout the post, he has lot of good, practical advice. Although it was ironic to see him <a href="https://twitter.com/dharmesh/status/700582762550587392">tweet this</a> just a day after this article:
</p>
<blockquote>
	Got to spend 9+ contiguous hours tinkering with Python code today.  Spent 0 time working on slides.  #goodtimes

<p>Scott H. Young is famous for taking challenges like MIT challenge and Year Without English challenge. So it is safe to say that he know how to choose projects. If you've read the above two articles and want to do less, read this article on how to choose from the list of man projects that you have always planned on starting. Make sure you choose the right one because:</p>

<blockquote>
	A bad choice can have equally disastrous consequences. It can tie up your time for years. It can feel like slogging through mud, struggling to wake up in the morning. I suspect bad projects have also been the cause of more than their fare share of existential crises.

	Okay, so this is easily one of the funniest and at the same time coolest article I've read this month. The writing style keeps you reading through the post even if you are not that good at coding. Basically, this post is about how the author played around with the online status data that FB sends and created graphs about when his/her friends slept. It is fascinating.

	If you have lot of time for Friday night reading or weekend reading, add this to your Pocket and read it at your leisure. This is a huge post by Jeff Deutsch and worth every single word.
</p>
<p>
	According to Jeff, he did 3 things accidentally right to make one of his previous articles viral:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<ol>Accidental win #1: Giving an audience something it desperately needed.
		</ol>
		<ol>Accidental win #2: Taking constructive criticism from awesome editors
		</ol>
		<ol>Accidental win #3: Getting Dharmesh to feature the article at the top of Inbound.org.
		</ol>
	</ul>

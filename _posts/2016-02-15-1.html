Starting off the Daily Five's blog with a sense of irony, I suggest you to read Nathan Kontny's post where he tells you the story of how Benjamin Franklin actually might not have found electricity but still was able to get the credit for it. Nathan gives you another example of how Ryan Hoover built Product Hunt. What do both these have in common? That's what Nathan explains in the article and along the way, he tells us how we can spread something that we have created.
</p>
<p>
From the post: <blockquote>If you’re dreaming about your own business, but reading this while working for someone else, or maybe you’ve already started something, but it’s far from being ready or good, don’t squander this time. Don’t wait. Start writing, teaching, and publishing today. Form groups of like-minded people and friends. So when you do have something of your own to spread, you’ll already have an audience happy to help.</blockquote>

<p>Mark Suster has written probably one of the best posts you will ever read this year. By the time I finished reading the post, I felt I have learned so much more than I could learn from an average book. Below is just one of the many good points from the post where Mark gives you a real life example about how VCs feel right now:</p>

<blockquote>Let me give you a non tech & thus non politically charged example. Let’s say you own a bunch of real estate property and you’ll likely buy more. You own 10 properties and you’ll probably buy 1-2 more per year for the next 10 years. When some properties have appreciated you like to sell them to get some liquidity and sometimes you sell the bad properties to get your money back and move on.
<p>
So prices start dropping. Are you thinking to yourself, “Awesome! Now I can buy more properties cheaply!” Of course life is more complicated. You’re really thinking that you had wanted to sell 2 of the properties that you thought has been over-valued and you were hoping to unload some poor performers. No you’re kind of fucked because nobody wants to buy any at all and your bank is calling you concerned that you may need to slow down your pace of new purchases for a bit.</p></blockquote>

It is not often you see someone write back to back posts of top notch quality in successive days. But Mark Suster did just that. In this post, he gives you a framework which you can use to decide for yourself what is the right level of burn rate for your startup. Apart from that he also tells you how to approach fund-raising:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
	My advice: be cautious, start early, get to know investors before you need capital, do your research on who is a likely good fit and understand that fund-raising is always part of your job – not something you do in “fund-raising season” for 2-3 months every other year.
</blockquote>

<p>
	I suggest you to bookmark both this and the above post and read it more than once.

	I'm a big fan of David Heinemeier Hansson's work, be it Rails or his blogs. His thought process and how he expresses them through words is something that impresses and at the same time inspires me.
</p>
<p>
	In this post, DHH talks about the scenario where a single client or customer or service provider of your service gets into a position to control your actions and how you could possibly identify it at the root.
</p>
<p>
	He closes the post with this:
	<blockquote>Don’t make any of your dependencies too big to fail. Whatever advantage you gain in the short term by saying yes is dread and misery later when you can’t say no.</blockquote>

<p>
	If you read this post after the first post in this list by Nathan, you will feel how well both the posts complement each other. While Nathan's post talks about building audience for an entrepreneur, Sean talks about how building an audience helps you in your corporate career. Both the principles are same but are just applied for different aspects. Just goes to show that no matter what you want to do in your life, you will never go wrong by writing your thoughts and building an audience.

	And if you feel there are already many blogs out there, here's what Sean has for you:
	<blockquote>I don’t know the industry you work in. But what I can tell you that your industry needs your voice. More people than those in the room with you each day deserve to see your take on things that matter. Especially if you find yourself complaining the “thought leaders” are the same tired faces getting all of the notice.</blockquote>

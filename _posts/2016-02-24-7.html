<p>
We tend to either over spend on information products or spend nothing at all. There must be a sweet spot in the middle where we buy really useful products and make full use of it. Scott Young explains a framework to use for getting great value from information products.

	Jason Toff explains the lessons he has learned as a GM of Vine, which includes lessons on team management, hiring and other things.

	One of the key points he makes about hiring fits very well for customer acquisition too:
</p>
<blockquote>
	A personal touch can be hugely impactful. When you’re competing for engineers with offers from Google, Facebook, etc., hiring can be tough. But it’s so incredibly important to get right. One tactic we found to be quite successful was to provide a personal touch. We’d same-day deliver gifts for candidates we wanted to close and bombard them with congratulation emails from interviewers.

<p>
	At first, the title might sound wrong but on reading the article, you come across some very good points like:
</p>

<blockquote>
	Employees don't want to be "satisfied" as much as they want to be engaged. What they want most is a great boss who cares about their development, and a company that focuses on and develops their strengths. Trying to satisfy employees' appetites for free lunches, lattes, and ping pong tables is giving people something they don't deeply want -- and that isn't natural or good for them. What you're doing is feeding the bears.

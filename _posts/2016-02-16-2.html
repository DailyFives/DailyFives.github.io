<p>
This is a story about how two friends hustled to get funded by 500 Startups. Kevin explains how he, along with his co-founder Ramakanth Dorai, literally stalked Paul Singh from 500 Startups when the latter had gone to Bangalore, India for meeting entrepreneurs.
</p>
<p>
	It is quite easy to give up after pitching someone and getting no response. But if you just try little bit harder (in a positive-not-stalking-everywhere way), you could get the attention of that one key person who might help your startup lift off the ground.
</p>
<p>
Kevin's biggest takeaway: <blockquote>If you’re persistent, you’ll always find a way to get what you want — as long as you never give up. We’re glad we didn’t. Hustled hard! Sometimes you have to do whatever it takes to win, to get what you want, to get noticed and what you truly deserve!</blockquote>

<p>Yesterday's Daily Five edition had two posts by Mark Suster on how hard it is for both startups and VCs. Danielle Morrill has written about how to prepare yourself and your startup for surviving what comes next. She points to some useful benchmarks which you might want to write down on a sticky note and read every day. Apart from that, she also writes about letting people working in your startup go before it hurts your startup:</p>

<blockquote>Break your lease, reduce your salaries, and assess who is doing the work that adds the most enterprise value and let all the other people go (there are laws about layoffs, get advice from an employment lawyer to avoid a company-killing lawsuit). Cut deeper than you think you need to, sooner than you think you have to. If the decision to keep someone is a coin toss, let them go.</blockquote>

AJ Agarwal explains the shift in marketing due to digital and how it is no longer a David vs Goliath but almost a level playing field for companies of all sizes. He writes about the change that has happened in various channels like paid advertising and customer service and how some of the traditional methods are obsolete. This article is posted on Forbes blog which will force their visitors to stop adblock before entering the page. Apart from that, this post is a must read especially for this nudget below:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	It’s led to many companies realizing that the traditional ad is dead, even in an online environment. Digital marketing channels have had to give something before they can get something back. This may be in the form of a free eBook or an entry into a competition.
</p><p>
At no point in history have companies had to give so much to prospective customers simply to stand a chance of gaining a conversion.
</p>
<p>
A conventional advertisement is no longer viable. You have to get creative.

<p>
Nick van Dam and Els van der Helm start the post by mentioning a survey of 180 business leaders where 4 out of 10 said they do not get enough sleep at least four nights a week. In a video I saw recently, Maria Popova says:
</p>
<blockquote>
	It's funny we have this mentality that wearing how little sleep we get by on as a badge or sort of validating our work ethic but really the only thing it speaks is the complete failure of self-respect and of priorities because what could be more important than our mental health and our sanity, which is the foundation for absolutely everything else.
</blockquote>
<p>
	With that said, Nick and Els makes a strong case on the relationship between sleep and organizational leadership.
</p>
<p>
	He closes the post with this:
	<blockquote>Don’t make any of your dependencies too big to fail. Whatever advantage you gain in the short term by saying yes is dread and misery later when you can’t say no.</blockquote>

	There are a few things everyone who is part of tech and startups should understand on some level. This is probably one of them. While you need not know how cryptography works, you will need to know that there are certain measures to be taken when storing a password. Even if you will never be implementing this, it is really interesting to know how all the passwords that we enter are kept safe.

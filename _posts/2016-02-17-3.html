<p>There is no strict theory that you can follow to build a multi-billion dollar business. Many things have to come in place and even if that happens, you need more. But what do Uber, Airbnb, WhatsApp and Netflix have in common apart from being valued in the billions and solving a problem? They all make it cheaper (or even free in the case of WhatsApp) than the already existing solutions.</p>

<p>Sarah said it best with this quote:</p>
<blockquote>It shouldn’t be a surprise that 10x + cheaper is such a killer combo for consumers. Who doesn’t want something better, cheaper? It also happens to be a great catalyst for word of mouth. People love to talk about a new service they discovered that’s better and saved them money — telling a friend how to save $20 can feel like actually giving the friend $20.</blockquote>

<p>Too often we worry about how to reach hundreds or thousands or millions. When we set a goal like that, it is often too easy to fail. Jon Westenberg explains about how you should make just one person care about what you do - be it a blog or an app or whatever it is and then everything else will start falling in place.</p>

<blockquote>But here’s what I know to be true. You don’t have to worry about getting a whole of people into what you’re doing. That’s not something you have to care about or concern yourself with.
	<br \>
	All you have to worry about is getting one single person to give a shit.

<p>
If you had read the past two editions of Daily Fives, you would have noticed that the posts about startups were mostly about how it is not a good time for startup founders. We featured two articles(<a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2016/02/14/what-most-people-dont-understand-about-how-startup-companies-are-valued/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2016/02/15/so-what-is-the-right-level-of-burn-rate-for-a-startup-these-days/">this</a>) by Mark Suster on the first edition and <a href="https://mattermark.com/how-to-not-die/">one by Danielle Morill</a>.
</p>
Heidi Roizen gives extremely good advice to startups on how to stay alive. She says:
<blockquote>
	When a market turns, we tend to see the signs earlier than the entrepreneurs working on the front lines.
This market?  I’d say it has turned.
It is going to be hard (or impossible) for many of today’s startups to raise funds.  And I think it will get worse before it gets better.
</blockquote>
<p>
Heidi asks you to stop clinging to your valuations, redeine what success looks like and to get to cash-flow positive on the capital you already have among other things. Another important point that she makes, which I want to highlight is:
</p>
<blockquote>
You know what kind of companies generally survive?  Companies that make more money than they spend.  I know, duh, right?  If you make more than you spend, you get to stay alive for a long time.  If you don’t, you have to get money from someone else to keep going.  And, as I just said, that’s going to be way harder now.  I’m embarrassed writing this because it is so flipping simple, yet it is amazing to me how many entrepreneurs are still talking about their plans to the next round.

<p>
Ali Mese writes about the power of centralized networks (like Medium, Hacker News, Dribble) and how even a single upvote on these centralized networks can get huge number of visitors for your work.
</p>
<p>
	He explains:
	<blockquote>
		Today, instead of visiting our loosely connected individual website, an increasing number of people look for answers on Quora, pictures on Instagram, videos on YouTube, slides on Slideshare, or articles on Medium.
		<br \>
		Thousands of design passionates meet on Designer News, inbound marketers on Inbound.org, tech geeks on Hacker News, product people on Product Hunt, or growth marketers on Growth Hackers. And the endless list goes on, to Reddit and all the others.
	</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
	Ali tells you how your work (blog/startup/app) could first be submitted to one place and then, if it's good, reach people and places your individual, loosely connected island never could (in his words). He also tells you how you can achieve this even if you don't have friends to help you at this moment.

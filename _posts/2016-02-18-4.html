Three groups of rats: One group was made to do long distance jogging, second group was made to climb a wall with weights attached to its tail and the third group was given high intensity interval training. The results from this study is very interesting.</p>

<p>In this post, Shayla Price explains how to make To-Do lists work. What might start as a blank page will end up with multiple pending tasks when maintaining todo lists and it can be very daunting. Shayla first tells you what is the problem with todo lists and gives you lot of practical advice to make it work for you.</p>

<blockquote>
	The problems with to-do lists:
	<ul>
		<li>First task feels most urgent
		</li>
		<li>Every task looks the same
		</li>
		<li>Rescheduling tasks is tough
		</li>
		<li>There's always something else to do
		</li>
	</ul>

Jon Westenberg doesn't dilly-dally with words. He gets straight to the point and tells you everything directly as it is. He makes it straight to the point. In this article, Jon explains about the holier than thou attitude that is prevalent in startups.

<blockquote>
Maybe you’ve spent too long watching Silicon Valley, or you’ve read too many middle-class-comfortable-rags to riches stories about young white kids who became incredibly wealthy.
<br \>
Well, fuck you.
<br \>
Do you know what a startup actually is? It’s a business, pure and simple.

	According to many studies, as Nir Eyal points out, social interactions impacts happiness and health. While it is easy to find friends in college, it is not so easy when we are an adult. There is no clear path or steps, with people concentrating more on their career. Nir Eyal writes about how to approach friendships as an adult and keep it going healthy.

	If you have written any code in the past 8 years, you would have search for a way to fix some issue or to find how to do somethng and most probably you would have ended up at this site. So it is actually amazing to read what goes behind serving a site that is frequently visited by tons of users every day. Nick Craver does a brilliant job of explaining this in the post.

Matt McCue starts the post with the famous quote from former Netscape CEO, Jim Barksdale:
<blockquote>If we have data, let's look at data. If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine.</blockquote>

	The design sprint works like this:
	<blockquote>
	Over the course of five days, sprint participants map out a project goal and find its problems (Monday), brainstorm solutions (Tuesday), make progress decisions (Wednesday), prototype (Thursday), and have users experience the prototype (Friday).

	We have all been guilty of letting things take control over us at some point in our lives. Most often, the solution is to simply opt-out, although that is not as easy as it sounds. One of the reasons I started Daily Fives is for this. I realized that I spend too much time reading low quality, and sometimes redundant stuff. To overcome this, I filtered out the blogs which post consistent good content and then spend 15 minutes to skim the surface of articles in social voting sites until I find something really good to read. The top 5 articles I read every day are the ones I share here.
